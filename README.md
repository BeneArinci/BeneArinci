### Hi there, I am Benedetta 👋  Thanks for visiting my Github page 😄

Here's something about who I am..

- 👶  a fullstack software developer
- 🔄  a career switcher. I used to be a tech recruiter
- a financial crime fighter at Cable tech!  🦸‍♀️ 
- 🖤  an empathetic individual who loves to spend time with other people  👯‍♀️
- always aiming to be a better person (and developer) than I was yesterday  💪

Feel free to reach out! I am at the beginning of my career and I am keen to grow my network. <br>
